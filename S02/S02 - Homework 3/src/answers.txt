A class can have any number of these. - instance variables, arguments, return types, getters, setters, methods

A method can have only one of these. - return type

This can be implicitly promoted. - instance variable

It really means 'make a copy'. - pass by valve

Only setters should update these. - instance variables

A method can have many of these. -instance variable, arguments

I return something by definition. - getter, return type,

I can have many arguments. - method

By definition, I take one argument. - setter
