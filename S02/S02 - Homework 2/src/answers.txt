1. Explain the modulo operator. You may need to consult more resources
(online Java language resources, other Java books, etc.) to find out the details.

2. What is the result of the expression (8 % 3) ?

3. What are all possible results of the expression (n % 5), where n is an integer variable?

4. What are all possible results of the expression (n % m), where n and m are integer variables?


1.) modulo is a division operator that show the remainder of the first number divided by the second.  op1 % op2

2.) the remainder of 8 % 3 is 2

3.) 1, 2, 3, 4, - once you hit the 5 there will no longer be a remainder

4.) lets call the remainder r, 0 < r < m  --OR -- r is greater than 0 and one less than m
