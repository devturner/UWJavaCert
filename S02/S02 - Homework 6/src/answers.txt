How does inheritance break encapsulation?

Inheritance exposes a subclass to details of its parent's implementation, thus it unhides the attempt to restrict information.

What are static and dynamic types and how are they different?
Static type: Can't be changed after it is compiled. The bindings are established at compiling.

Dynamic type: They bindings will written at runtime and can change depending on the method called.
